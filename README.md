| **User**     | id, name, email, password\_hash, role                     | One user can own multiple properties; can place multiple bookings; can post multiple reviews. |
| **Property** | id, title, description, location, price, owner\_id        | Belongs to one user; can have multiple bookings and reviews.                                  |
| **Booking**  | id, user\_id, property\_id, check\_in, check\_out, status | Belongs to one user and one property.                                                         |
| **Payment**  | id, booking\_id, amount, currency, status, created\_at    | One-to-one with Booking; records transaction details.                                         |
| **Review**   | id, user\_id, property\_id, rating, comment, created\_at  | Belongs to one user and one property.                                                         |

## API Security

To protect user data and ensure secure transactions, the following measures will be implemented:

* **Authentication:**

  * JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
  * Access & refresh token rotation.
* **Authorization:**

  * Role-based access control (RBAC) for endpoints (e.g., only owners can modify their listings).
* **Data Validation & Sanitization:**

  * Input validation at serializer level to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:**

  * Throttle requests per IP/user to prevent DDoS and brute-force attempts.
* **HTTPS Enforcement:**

  * Enforce TLS for all API traffic to secure data in transit.
* **CSRF Protection:**

  * Ensure CSRF tokens on state-changing operations (if cookies are used). |

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Overview:**
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) automates testing and delivery to ensure rapid, consistent updates.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Build & Lint:** Run static analysis (flake8, black) on each PR.
2. **Unit & Integration Tests:** Execute test suite (pytest) and ensure all tests pass.
3. **Docker Build:** Build Docker images for backend service.
4. **Deploy to Staging:** Automatically deploy to a staging environment on merge to `main` branch.
5. **Smoke Tests:** Run basic health checks against staging.
6. **Production Deployment:** Manual approval for production rollout.

**Tools:**

* **GitHub Actions:** Define workflows for build, test, and deploy.
* **Docker & Docker Compose:** Containerize services for local and CI environments.
* **Heroku / AWS ECS / Kubernetes:** Potential targets for deployment.
